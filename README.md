he Roboticia-quattro is suited to understand the walk on four legs and to learn robotic without difficulties.

It is particularly well suited for educational purposes (cheap, simple to assemble, and easily controllable).
There are possibilities of advanced control with its very accurate force sensor on each paw. 
This means that this robot is able to walk on natural ground.
